    <h3>OUTPUT Pixel Size (meters/pixel)</h3>
    <p>
        The output mosaic is resampled to the specified pixel resolution (meters).

        <li>Example: 6.0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Generally, this should be the lowest resolution of all the input images to avoid uneven image quality. Increasing the resolution can dramatically increase the output mosaic size and processing time, and may produce unsatisfactory results. Typical pixel scales for CTX are 5.5 to 6.5 meters. HRSC scales are typically 12.0 or 12.5 pixels, although some HRSC collections may be 20, 50, or 100 meters. HiRISE mosaicks are typically 0.25 to 2.0m/pxl (with 1.0m/pxl a good balance between processing time and image quality).
