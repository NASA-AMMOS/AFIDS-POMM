    <h1>Planets</h1>
    <p>
        Choose one planet/moon for your study case. Planet-specific mosaicking and mapping software has been developed and tested for Mars, Earth, and the Earthâ€™s Moon/Luna, and installed, but not tested for Ceres and Europa. The POMM mapping software assumes a hard-body spherical world and is currently incompatible with irregular-shaped and small bodies (e.g., asteroids). Future support for gas planets is problematic given the motion associated with their surface expression.
