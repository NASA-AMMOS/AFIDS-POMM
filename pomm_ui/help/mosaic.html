    <h1>Mosaic</h1>
    <p>
        This option mosaics two or more adjacent map-projected images. The inputs can be from different satellite sensors and resolutions (e.g., CTX and HRSC) as long as they are map-projected, overlap, and have similar brightness histograms. There is no specific limit to the number of input images to mosaic, but specifying a very large mosaic should be considered relative to available cpu performance and disk space resources. All input images (or links) must be in one directory. Directory path and filenames must follow standard Linux filename conventions (e.g., no blanks or special characters). Accepted map/georeferenced file formats include: .tif (geotiff); .jp2 (jpeg2000); .img (PDS); and .vic (vicarGT). 100% overlapping images will not be “blended” in the output mosaic, but co-registered and output as separate image files.
