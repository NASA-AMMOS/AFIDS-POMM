    <h1>Co-Register</h1>
    <p>This option adjusts the geometry of a secondary image to align with the first (master reference) image. Use this tool to co-register and stack time series satellite images that may have offsets (200+ meters) relative to each other. The inputs can be from different satellite sensors and resolutions (e.g., CTX and HRSC) as long as they are map-projected and have a large overlap. The secondary image can be matched to dimensions of the master image (Option 1), or both (master and secondary images) trimmed to the size of the secondary image (with padding; Option 2). A tiepoint file is output, but is relative to the master image and an intermediate projected version of the second image (also output). Note that the quality of the co-registration will be limited by the quality of the original map projections (and their elevation models in high terrain areas). The input images (or links) must be in one local directory. Directory path and filenames should must follow standard Linux filename conventions (e.g., no blanks or special characters). Accepted georeferenced file formats include: .tif (geotiff); .jp2 (jpeg2000); .img (PDS); and .vic (vicarGT).</p>
