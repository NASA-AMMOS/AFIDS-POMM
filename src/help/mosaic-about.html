    <h1>About Mosaicking</h1>
    <p>This option mosaics two or more adjacent map-projected images. The inputs can be from different satellite sensors and resolutions (e.g., CTX and HRSC) as long as they are map-projected, overlap, and have similar brightness histograms. There is no specific limit to the number of input images to mosaic, but specifying a very large mosaic should be considered relative to available cpu performance and disk space resources. All input images (or links) must be in one directory. Accepted map/georeferenced file formats include: .tif (geotiff); .jp2 (jpeg2000); .img (PDS); and .vic (vicarGT). POMM employs automated mosaicking techniques for near-seamless geometric edge matching, brightness feathering and block adjustment between and across images. 100% overlapping images will not be “blended” in the output mosaic, but co-registered and output as separate image files. Disconnected images (“islands”) will not be matched or feathered with neighboring images, and can significantly expand the size of the mosaic. Mosaic outputs include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>prefix_mosaic.tif</i> — Output multi-image mosaic.</li>
        <li><i>prefix_1st_input_filename.tif</i> — First image in mosaic space; Not edge matched.</li>
        <li><i>prefix_2nd_input_filename.tif</i> — Second image in mosaic space; Not edge matched.</li>
        <li><i>etc.</i></li>
        <li><i>prefix_mosaic_log.csv</i> — POMM/VICAR/AFIDS processing log (text).</li>
        <li><i>prefix_mosaic_receipt.csv</i> — POMM receipt (summary) text file.</li>
    </ul>
