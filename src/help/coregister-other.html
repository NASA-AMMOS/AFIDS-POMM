    <h3>Other Default Parameters</h3>
    <p>These are default POMM co-registration parameters that have been found to provide a balance between speed and accuracy. However, if better accuracy is required, the “fftgrd” parameter can be increased to a maximum of 64. In general, these parameters should not be changed without an understanding of their function.</p>
