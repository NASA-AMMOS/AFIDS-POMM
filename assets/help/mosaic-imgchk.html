    <h3>OVERRIDE Image Verification Warning?</h3>
    <p>All input images are checked for a variety of simple issues. If a problem is found, the processing is halted with a warning message. Errors such as "files-not-found" and "unsupported file format" must obviously be corrected immediately, but a difference between 8 or 16-bit format might be fine if their histograms are similar. In that case, click the
        <b>Yes</b> box to override the Image Check and continue processing. The default is
        <b>No</b>
        , don't override, and stop processing if an issue is detected.
